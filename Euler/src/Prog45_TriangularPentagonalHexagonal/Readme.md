六邊形數

The first thing to note is that the set of hexagonal numbers is a subset of triangle numbers if we substitute n = 2m – 1 into the triangle number equation we get

T_n = (2m -1)((2m-1) 1)/2 = (2m-1)2m/2 = m(2m-1)

Which indeed is the formula for hexagonal numbers. That means all triangular number based on an odd n is a hexagonal numbers.
