# Pentagon numbers
Problem 44

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk − Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?

1. Find Pn, Pm for which sum and difference are pentagonal
2. Find Minimized D = |Pn-Pm|

解法:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145,
  4  7  10  13  16  19  22  25   28
    3  3  3   3   3   3   3   3
    
    
 f(n) = 3n^2-n / 2

 1. 簡單的數式可以直接展開,執行效率快
 2. 要會找出reverse function
